I’m Rohit Agrawal, a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable backend systems and data-driven applications. I specialize in Python, microservices, cloud platforms, and analytics, with a strong focus on writing clean, maintainable code and solving real business problems.

Currently, I work at OakNorth, where I design and develop backend services for financial and analytics platforms. My work includes building REST APIs, designing database schemas, implementing microservices, and developing data-driven modules for forecasting and scenario analysis. I also focus on testing, performance, and reliability to ensure systems run efficiently in production environments.  ￼

Before OakNorth, I spent several years at Teradata, where I worked on analytics platforms and data science tooling. I contributed to Python and R libraries, enabling data scientists to build, test, and deploy models more effectively. I also gained hands-on experience with DevOps practices, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.  ￼

Over the years, I’ve developed strong skills in Python, SQL, AWS, and microservices architecture, along with exposure to AI, analytics, and data platforms. I enjoy designing systems from scratch and improving existing systems to make them more scalable and efficient.

I’m originally from Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, and have been based in Hyderabad since 2014. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and experimenting with different cuisines, especially Indian food. I’m also focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and I make time for workouts whenever possible.

I’m naturally curious and always looking to learn new technologies, especially in areas like AI and data-driven systems, and apply them to real-world problems.
